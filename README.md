# Repository
https://github.com/ArianiL/final.git 

# Description
CollabDraw is a collaborative drawing program that allows multiple users to work together in real-time on a shared canvas. It enables users to express their creativity, collaborate with others, and create collaborative artworks regardless of their physical location. This project is relevant to digital arts and media as it promotes collaboration, creativity, and community engagement through a digital platform.

# Features
- Real-time Collaboration: Multiple users can connect to the same canvas and see each other's changes in real-time, fostering collaboration and teamwork.
- Shared Canvas: The program provides a shared canvas where users can draw, paint, and sketch together, with changes instantly visible to all participants.
- Drawing Tools: A variety of drawing tools including brushes, pencils, erasers, shapes, and text for users to create their artwork.

# Challenges
- Real-time Synchronization: Implementing real-time synchronization of drawing actions across multiple users while maintaining performance and consistency.
- Conflict Resolution: Developing algorithms to handle conflicts when multiple users attempt to edit the same area of the canvas simultaneously.

# Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is to create a seamless and engaging collaborative drawing platform that fosters creativity, communication, and community interaction among users.

# Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome is a functional collaborative drawing program with basic real-time collaboration, drawing tools, and chat functionality, demonstrating its potential for collaborative artwork creation.
